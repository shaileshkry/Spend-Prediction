Spend Prediction
Overview
The objective of this project is to predict customer spending based on a set of features provided in the dataset. The goal is to leverage machine learning models to accurately predict future spending habits, which can be useful for businesses to optimize their operations and target customers more effectively. This project utilizes various regression techniques to model and predict spending patterns.

Dataset
The dataset Spend.csv contains several features related to customer demographics and behaviors, with the target variable being customer spend. This data is used to train and evaluate different machine learning models for regression tasks.

Features:
Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer
Age: Age of the customer
Income: Customer's income level
Spending Score: A score assigned based on customer spending habits
Other Features: Additional features related to customer behaviors (e.g., membership duration, location, etc.)
Target:
Spend: The amount of money a customer spends in a given period
Methodology
Preprocessing:
Handling Missing Values: If any missing values exist in the dataset, they are handled appropriately by imputing them with the mean, median, or other suitable methods.
Feature Scaling: Features are scaled to ensure that models can converge effectively during training.
Model Building:
Several regression algorithms are tested to predict the spending behavior:
Linear Regression
RandomForestRegressor
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
Decision Tree Regressor
Model Evaluation:
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-Squared Score (R²)
Model Selection:
The performance of each model is compared, and the model with the best predictive performance is selected for future predictions.
